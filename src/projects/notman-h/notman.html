			<h3>Notman House Entrance Dashboard</h3>
			<p>
				<a href='http://notman.org/' target="_blank">Notman House</a> is a renowned start-up incubator in Downtown Montreal. OSMO Cafe, Notmanâ€™s communal space situated on the ground floor, offers an open door to the startup community. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The "<a href = 'http://betakit.com/notman-house-goes-smart-home-with-hack-the-house/' target="_blank">Hack The House</a>" Hackathon series intend to turn Notman House into a Smart House using Internet of Things. The  <a href="http://notman-entrance-dashboard.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html" target="_blank">Entrance Dashboard</a> of the Osmo Cafe, which is part of this project, gives the cafe visitors relevant information about the House and its environments.

				In August 2016, taking part in a weekend-long session of the HackTheHouse hackathons, I started the work on a new component for the Osmo Cafe Entrance Dashboard, coded with ReactJS. The component processes an API of the STM and displays the absolute and relative time of the next two buses for 3 bus lines around the area. In September the component was approved by the Notman House IT community and was added to the dashboard - <a href="https://github.com/danamn/notman-entrance-dashboard" target="_blank">Link to the GitHub Repository</a>.
