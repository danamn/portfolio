In november 2015 I started learning HTML, CSS and Python, then dived into JavaScript. And after living the fun of creating and playing with visual elements and the satisfaction of soving programming challenges, everything changed. 

Since  then I spent many evenings, weekends and full days learning and practicing - jQuery, React, Sass, Webpack - with one goal in mind: to become a professional web developer. 

I brought with me general tech knowledge from my days as an IT recruiter, learning self-discipline and ability to search for relevant information from my university studies, a natural inclination towards objectivity and logic, as well as a curious, intelligent and mathematical mind. These, combined with my dedication and pleasure for programming, have helped me make fast progress and develop incresingly complex projects that you can discover browsing my site.

I am now open for front-end development challenges where I can contribute with my enthusiasm and knowledge and where I can keep learning and growing as a programmer.
