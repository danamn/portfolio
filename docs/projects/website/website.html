								<p> Every language has quirks which can be used to give text personality and style. From politeness markers to wordplay, from hidden meanings to double entendre, it takes time, skill and, I would argue, a good measure of linguistic enthusiasm to carry these idiosyncrasies into another language. 
								</p>
								<p> When translating your document, I go through several steps to make sure that although the words you have written are changing, the spirit of your writing remains. 
								</p>
								<p> 1. <span>Assessment: </span> I read the text in its entirety several times to identify its key elements. Who is speaking, to what public and in which tone? Is the inflection rather formal, or more relaxed? What is the quality of the original writing and can I improve on it? Is there any technical subject matter requiring research on my part? How is the document structured? Are there sections, paragraphs or sentences being repeated throughout the document? Is there a literary quality to the text? Are there concealed lexicons, undertones, hidden meanings, lyrical musings? Which importance do these different elements hold in relation to each other? The answers to these questions will determine pricing. 
								</p>
								<p> 2. <span> Research: </span> I research any technical, scientific or specialized subject matter I am not familiar with. In order to transmit the right information, it is paramount that I understand the topic fully and am able to give it some context. Not every document requires the same amount of research. The more technical your document is, the more research will be needed. However, I also translate many standalone documents requiring no research at all. The amount of research is reflected in pricing.
								</p>
								<p> 3. <span> Translation: </span> I go through the document from beginning to end, translating paragraph by paragraph. I research linguistic issues and wrestle with sentences. There is squinting, highlighting and furious hammering of the backspace key. 
								</p>
								<p> 4. <span> Distancing / Proofreading: </span> In order to ensure efficient proofreading, I leave the document alone for a period of time depending on the deadline. For short texts, one day is usually enough. I then return to the translated document and read it over, correcting any linguistic errors and comparing it to the original for any omissions or ambiguities. Any questions I may still have are added to the document as comments, including suggestions for alternate translations. Clients are encouraged to write back with additional information, enabling me to further improve upon the translation.

				 					No matter how eloquent the passage or how wise the idea behind it, an otherwise credible message can be undermined by the smallest mistake. Although most text editors are nowadays equipped with spellchecking software, many errors go undetected. Some lexical or syntactical errors can only be rooted out by the thinking brain because they relate to meaning, something your average smartphone can't always grasp. If you need more convincing of the importance of proofreading, perhaps <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OonDPGwAyfQ'>Taylor Mali</a> is the right person to turn to.<br>
